> Give Firebase wings! - Useful helper-functions for Firebase's JS SDK.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Firebase installed in your project and Firestore initiated.

```json
"dependencies": {
  "firebase": "^5.5.9"
}
```

## Install

```bash
npm i firewings
```

## Setup

Add the below code to wherever you want to use the functions.

```js
import { queryFirestore } from 'firewings'
//or
import { unwrapFirestoreDoc } from 'firewings'
```

## Included Functions

### queryFirestore()

**OLD WAY**:

```js
/** 1. Define ref/query */
const query = db.collection('cities')

/** 2. Get Snapshot */
let snapshot
try {
  snapshot = await queryFirestore(query)
} catch (e) {
  //error handling
}

/** 3.1 Get data from Snapshot if single-doc query */
const city = snapshot.data()

/** 3.2 Get data from Snapshot if multiple-doc query */
let cities = []
for (const doc of snapshot.docs) {
  let city = doc.data()
  cities.push(city)
}
```

**WITH FIREWINGS**:

```js
/** For single-doc queries */
const query = db.collection('cities')
try {
  const cities = await queryFirestore(query)
} catch (e) {
  //error handling
}
```

```js
/** For multi-doc queries */
const query = db.collection('cities').doc('cityId')
try {
  const city = await queryFirestore(query)
} catch (e) {
  //error handling
}
```

### unwrapFirestoreDoc()

This function unwraps a Firestore snapshot of a single- or multiple-document query and returns the items' data as objects. Either as an array of objects or as a single object.

Additionally, it adds the documents `id` and `path` to every item.

**OLD WAY**:

```js
/** For single-doc queries */
const city = snapshot.data()
city.id = snapshot.id
city.path = snapshot.ref.path
```

```js
/** For multi-doc queries */
let cities = []
for (const doc of snapshot.docs) {
  let city = doc.data()
  item.id = doc.id
  item.path = doc.ref.path
  items.push(item)
}
```

**WITH FIREWINGS**:

```js
/** For single-doc queries */
const city = unwrapFirestoreDoc(snapshot)
```

```js
/** For multi-doc queries */
const cities = unwrapFirestoreDoc(snapshot)
```

### Disclaimer

These are some functions I personally reuse in different Firebase projects to save some repeating lines of code. I don't plan to do much more here and I might change things drastically. I will probably keep it up to date, but cannot guarantee anything.
